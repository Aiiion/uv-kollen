## Open Development & Community Driven
UV-Kollen is an open-source project. All the work done is available on GitHub and the `master` branch is hosted on [uvkollen.se](https://www.uvkollen.se).
All contributors, including me, send pull requests which go through the same validation process.

- *Specific*. Include as much detail as possible: which device you use, how you have interacted with the website, etc.

- *Scoped to a Single Bug*. One bug per issue.
